# Hi there üëã I'm Matt.

I'm Matthieu Benedict, a first year student in NSCC's game programming progam specializing in Level Design and Gameplay Programming. I've dabbled in software engineering, IT, and management best practices, but my true love is game programming. I know a few different programming languages and am always hungry for more experience in the industry!

## üíº I‚Äôm currently working on...
Right now my main project is a text-based RPG project coded from scratch using C#. This project started off as an assignment for NSCC's "Game Programming" course, but I am in the process of expanding it beyond the scope of the original assignment. My main goal with this project is to use it as an opportunity to brush up on my OOP and documentation skills. Techniques I am trying to utilize with this project are abstraction, inheretence, as well as other key pillars of OOP like encapsulation. Currently the game generates its map from a text file, though I am planning on adding in elements of proceedural generation to the game for levels enemies and loot. In its present state the game has a working player, enemies, and tiles. Soon there will be more added to the game.

At the moment I am working on cleaning up some of the code to better acomodate abstraction, as well as working on creating documentation resources outside of the project such as UML Class diagrams as well a Github Wiki for the project. I look forwards to having more to share on this in the future. 

## üìÇ Things I've done...
I've done a few things in the field of programming. here are some highlights.

### üéÆ Game Projects:
Here are some of the games I've made.

#### MetroidVania Prototype:
This is a solo project of mine that was started as part of an iterative design project for NSCC's "Game Development" course. The game can be found [here](https://twitchton.itch.io/metroidvania-prototype) on my itch.io page and is free to play. I used the project to prototype gameplay systems would be found in a MetroidVania action-platformer style of game. Some highlights from these systems are wall sliding, wall jumping, dashing, and creating an attack handler that isn't tied to character animations. The majority of the development time in this game was spent trying to refine the abilities of the player and tune them to create an intuitive and good feeling set of controls. Some other things from this project that I'm proud of is learning state machines for basic enemy AI as well as learning how to use Unity's built in tile system and animation system for sprites.

As part of the submissions for NSCC's "Game Development" course I also catalogued my work on the game through a short video for each sprint I completed for the game. Those videos can be found in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdYTklGnodY&list=PLYCHzlj4rAu38qnKfRdh80x80c-6fof64) playlist on youtube. I don't have any plans to expand on this prototype in the near future, but plan on eventually creating a short design document for a game that could come from the prototypes systems from this project.

#### Haunted Hospital
This is another one of my NSCC solo projects. This assignment was for NSCC's "Game Engine" course, and was an assignment designed to teach Unity's sequencing and trigger systems, though I decided to expand on what the assignment was doing by trying to implement aspects of environmental story telling to the level. My main goal with this project was to evoke a foreboding/creepy atmosphere using Unity's lighting systems, sound systems, triggers, and timelines. Another key aspect I tried to keep in mind was the significance of using closed doors, and flickering lights as a visual motif in the level design. The game can be found [here](https://twitchton.itch.io/hospital-horror) on itch.io if you would like to see how the atmosphere of the game turned out for yourself.

#### Break Your Maker:
This is a game I made with some friends as part of a university course I was taking (found [here](https://twitchton.itch.io/break-your-maker) on itch.io). It was a small top down shooter game used to explore applying proceedural generation to a game. You play as a super soldier trying to escape the lab that made you. Make your way through the randomly generated level to find the key card and fight the boss to earn your freedom! My contribution to this project was level design, map generation, and power ups. I modified a random walk algorithm to help proceeduraly generate the level, and also made the room layouts using Unity's tile system. I additionally helped program the power up in the game as well as program the chests.

### üïπÔ∏è Game Jams:
Here are some Game Jams I've participated in.

#### GMTK GameJam-2023: WorldWide Casino:
In the GMTK GameJam-2023 I helped make a game called "World Wide Casino" (found [here](https://arizoba.itch.io/worldwide-casino) on itch.io). For the prompt "Rolls Reversed" we made a game where you play as the boss in an old "Time Crisis" style shooting game. You must avoid the player's shots and make your way back to your casino to retrieve your gun and turn the tables against the player.

#### DIG GameJam 2023: Mutual Card Game:
The DIG GameJam is a game jam run locally (in Halifax) through the Dalhousie Interactive Games Society, a Dalhousie club for students interested in persuing game creation. This was the first GameJam hosted by them, and the theme for the GameJam was "Mutual Gain". I teamed up with some of my peers at NSCC to make a game for this GameJam, and together we came up with the idea of a card game based off a trading mechanic. The idea was players would have to work with their hand of cards to get the highest point total, collected by getting numbered cards of the player's suit, by trading with other players and using power cards (face cards). If You're interested you can find the game on [itch.io](https://twitchton.itch.io/mutual-card-gain).

### üìã Other:
I've also gained experience in programming non-game related applications. Currently, I help manage a couple websites for a small company called "Qualiti7". I help manage their [main website](https://qualiti7.com/) as well as their [conferene website](https://iq7conference.com/?lang=en). Feel free to check them out.
