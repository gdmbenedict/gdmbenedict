# Hi there 👋 I'm Matt.

I'm Matthieu Benedict, a first year student in NSCC's game programming progam. I've dabbled in software engineering, IT, and management best practices, but my true love is game programming. I know a few different programming languages and am always hungry for more experience in the industry!

## 💼 I’m currently working on...
I'm currently working on a prototype for a MetroidVania game (working title: Vain) for my game development class. The core elements of this game are of course 2D action combat and platforming. An elevator pitch for this game may be something like this: "Betrayed and cast down from divinity by her children, the goddess must now make her way back up the divine tower to take back her powers and enact her revenge".

Right now I'm in the prototyping / pre-production phase of this project.

If you want to see updates on the project you can do so by view [this playlist](https://youtube.com/watch?v=xdYTklGnodY&list=PLYCHzlj4rAu38qnKfRdh80x80c-6fof64&index=1&t=0s).

I'm also working on making a text based rpg in the same style as Rogue. this project is still just in it's begining phases and there isn't enough to show here, but I will have updates on the project here in the future.

## 📂 Things I've done...
I've done a few things in the field of programming. here are some highlights.

### 🎮 Game Projects:
Here are some of the games I've made.
#### Break Your Maker:
This is a game I made with some friends as part of a university course I was taking (found [here](https://twitchton.itch.io/break-your-maker) on itch.io). It was a small top down shooter game used to explore applying proceedural generation to a game. You play as a super soldier trying to escape the lab that made you. Make your way through the randomly generated level to find the key card and fight the boss to earn your freedom!

### 🕹️ Game Jams:
Here are some Game Jams I've participated in.

#### GMTK GameJam-2023: WorldWide Casino:
In the GMTK GameJam-2023 I helped make a game called "World Wide Casino" (found [here](https://arizoba.itch.io/worldwide-casino) on itch.io). For the prompt "Rolls Reversed" we made a game where you play as the boss in an old "Time Crisis" style shooting game. You must avoid the player's shots and make your way back to your casino to retrieve your gun and turn the tables against the player.

#### DIG GameJam 2023: Mutual Card Game:
The DIG GameJam is a game jam run locally (in Halifax) through the Dalhousie Interactive Games Society, a Dalhousie club for students interested in persuing game creation. This was the first GameJam hosted by them, and the theme for the GameJam was "Mutual Gain". I teamed up with some of my peers at NSCC to make a game for this GameJam, and together we came up with the idea of a card game based off a trading mechanic. The idea was players would have to work with their hand of cards to get the highest point total, collected by getting numbered cards of the player's suit, by trading with other players and using power cards (face cards). If You're interested you can find the game on [itch.io](https://twitchton.itch.io/mutual-card-gain).

### 📋 Other:
I've also gained experience in programming non-game related applications. Currently, I help manage a couple websites for a small company called "Qualiti7". I help manage their [main website](https://qualiti7.com/) as well as their [conferene website](https://iq7conference.com/?lang=en). Feel free to check them out.
