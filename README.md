# Hi there 👋 I'm Matt.

I'm Matthieu Benedict, a first year student in NSCC's game programming progam specializing in Level Design and Gameplay Programming. I've dabbled in software engineering, IT, and management best practices, but my true love is game programming. I know a few different programming languages and am always hungry for more experience in the industry!

## 💼 I’m currently working on...
My main project at the moment is making a game design document for a theoretical horror game, done as part of my Game Design class at NSCC. The concept of the game is to have a survival horror game in the vein of "Silent Hill" that focueses on ARG elements in its gameplay. If you're interested in the concept, then you can check out the documentation I've made on [this](https://github.com/gdmbenedict/GDD-Horror-Game/wiki) Github wiki.

## 📂 Things I've done...
I've done a few things in the field of programming. here are some highlights.

### 🎮 Game Projects:
Here are some of the games I've made.

#### Shooter Tech Demo
This is a project I have worked on as part of my Game Mechanics class at NSCC. This was a solo development porject meant to test my skills in applying programming to create game systems using an engine. Some of the mechanics implemented in this tech demo were: Enemy AI states (Patrolling, Searching, Chasing, Attacking, and Retreating), instantiating projectiles, collectables, a respawn system, exploding projectiles, and wall running. I also added increased physics capabilities to the tech demo as it relates to the player by making a custom controller using Unity's physics Rigidbody system. I am still working on adding more polish to this project, and it will go up on Itch.io in the near future if you're interested in checking it out.

#### Text RPG
This project is one that I made as part of my Game Programming class at NSCC. It is a text RPG game in the style of older computer rpgs like Rogue, Net-hack, and Moria. I made it completely from scratch, programming in simple enemy AI, loading from text documents, items, and other mechanics. The main focus of this project was focusing on OOP and the architecture of code in games. I really liked this project because it's made me appreciate how much needs to go into even simple mechanics I've taken for granted. This is still a project in active development so it's not available as a playable build, but you can take a look at the code on its publically available github repository [here](https://github.com/gdmbenedict/TextRPG_V2). *Comments in the code are pending.

#### Haunted Hospital
This is another one of my NSCC solo projects. This assignment was for NSCC's "Game Engine" course, and was an assignment designed to teach Unity's sequencing and trigger systems, though I decided to expand on what the assignment was doing by trying to implement aspects of environmental story telling to the level. My main goal with this project was to evoke a foreboding/creepy atmosphere using Unity's lighting systems, sound systems, triggers, and timelines. Another key aspect I tried to keep in mind was the significance of using closed doors, and flickering lights as a visual motif in the level design. The game can be found [here](https://twitchton.itch.io/hospital-horror) on itch.io if you would like to see how the atmosphere of the game turned out for yourself.

### 🕹️ Game Jams:
Here are some Game Jams I've participated in.

#### Global GameJam-2024: Dad-Sim 1997:
In the Global GameJam-2024 I took part in a team effort of some NSCC students and a Dalhousie student to create a game with the prompt "Make me Laugh". Our group decided to make a goofy physics based collection of minigames, in the style of a game like "Octodad". The I contributed programming for the player controls, some of the mini-games, as well as the UI and menus for the game. Unfortunetly, we were not able to complete our vision for the game by the end of the Jam, but I've gotten together with some members of the teams to fix some issues with the game and release it on itch.io. In the meantime, what we were able to complete by the GameJam deadline can be found on the official Global gameJam website [here](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2024/dad-simulator-1997-4).

#### GMTK GameJam-2023: WorldWide Casino:
In the GMTK GameJam-2023 I helped make a game called "World Wide Casino" (found [here](https://arizoba.itch.io/worldwide-casino) on itch.io). For the prompt "Rolls Reversed" we made a game where you play as the boss in an old "Time Crisis" style shooting game. You must avoid the player's shots and make your way back to your casino to retrieve your gun and turn the tables against the player.

#### DIG GameJam 2023: Mutual Card Game:
The DIG GameJam is a game jam run locally (in Halifax) through the Dalhousie Interactive Games Society, a Dalhousie club for students interested in persuing game creation. This was the first GameJam hosted by them, and the theme for the GameJam was "Mutual Gain". I teamed up with some of my peers at NSCC to make a game for this GameJam, and together we came up with the idea of a card game based off a trading mechanic. The idea was players would have to work with their hand of cards to get the highest point total, collected by getting numbered cards of the player's suit, by trading with other players and using power cards (face cards). If You're interested you can find the game on [itch.io](https://twitchton.itch.io/mutual-card-gain).

### 📋 Other:
I've also gained experience in programming non-game related applications. Currently, I help manage a couple websites for a small company called "Qualiti7". I help manage their [main website](https://qualiti7.com/) as well as their [conferene website](https://iq7conference.com/?lang=en). Feel free to check them out.
