### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Matt.

I'm Matthieu Benedict is a first year student in NSCC's game programming progam. I've dabbled in software engineering, IT, and managment best practices, but my true love is game programming. I know a few different programming languages and am always hungry for more experience in the industry!

#### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 

I'm currently working on a prototype for a MetroidVania game (working title: Vain) for my game development class. The core elements of this game are of course 2D action combat and platforming. An elevator pitch for this game may be something like this: "Betrayed and cast down from divinity by her children, the goddess must now make her way back up the divine tower to take back her powers and enact her revenge".

Right now I'm working on a combat re-work for the game to provide some more fluid and responsive combat than my first prototype build of the project.
